/////////////////////  Streams IN NODE JS   //////////////////

Streams are one of the fundamental concepts of Node.js. Streams are a type of data-handling methods and are used to read or write input into output sequentially.
Streams is one of the most important and difficult topic in Node.js. It comes into play when you're working with a large amount of data

Node.js documentation defines streams as “A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.” 

In short, Streams are objects in Node.js that lets the user read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner.

What makes streams powerful while dealing with large amounts of data is that instead of reading a file into memory all at once, 
streams actually read chunks of data, processing its content data without keeping it all in memory
