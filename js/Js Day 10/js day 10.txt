Spread and Rest Operator
Destructuring

Synchronous: As the name suggests synchronous means to be in a sequence, 
		i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one. So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement 
		to get executed.
Asynchronous: 
Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately where the synchronous code 
will block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one

Promises
In JavaScript, a promise is just like a promise that you make in real life to show that you are committed to doing something

Async/Await
async and await make promises easier to write
async makes a function return a Promise
await makes a function wait for a Promise
