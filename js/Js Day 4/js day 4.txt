->15    reverse	             Reverses the order of the elements in an array

->16    keys	             Returns a Array Iteration Object, containing the keys of the original array

->17    pop	                 Removes the last element of an array, and returns that element

->18    push	             Adds new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length

->19    shift	             Removes the first element of an array, and returns that element

->20    unshift	             Adds new elements to the beginning of an array, and returns the new length

->21    slice	             Selects a part of an array, and returns the new array

->22    splice	             Adds / Removes elements from an array

->23    sort	             Sorts the elements of an array

->24    toString	         Converts an array to a string, and returns the result

->25    map	                 Creates a new array with the result of calling a function for each array element

->26    filter	             Creates a new array with every element in an array that pass a test

->27    reduce	             Reduce the values of an array to a single value(going left - to - right)

Js Objects

A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.


There are 3 ways to create objects.

By object literal
By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
By using an object constructor (using new keyword)

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
    In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
    In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.



Object.entries()              This method returns an array with arrays of the key, value pairs.
Object.values()               This method returns an array of values.
Object.keys()                 This method returns an array of a given object's own property names.
Object.assign()               This method is used to copy enumerable and own properties from a source object to a target object
Object.freeze()               This method prevents existing properties from being removed.




Js Math Functions:

abs	                It returns the absolute value of the given number.
cbrt	            It returns the cube root of the given number.
ceil	            It returns a smallest integer value, greater than or equal to the given number.
floor	            It returns largest integer value, lower than or equal to the given number.
log	                It returns natural logarithm of a number.
max	                It returns maximum value of the given numbers.
min	                It returns minimum value of the given numbers.
pow	                It returns value of base to the power of exponent.
random              It returns random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
round	            It returns closest integer value of the given number.
sqrt	            It returns the square root of the given number
trunc	            It returns an integer part of the given number.
